    Filename: _dataloader.py
    Description: _dataloader.py is a universal controller that controls data input to your
        self-defined network. It could collocate your data to multiple mini-batch, which
        could accelerate calculation speed. Furthermore, it could let networks learn more
        useful information. It could also shuffle your original dataset to make sure that
        networks don't learn something that is unnecessary.
