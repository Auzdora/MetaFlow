    Filename: _datasets.py
    Description: _datasets.py provides an abstract class for every kind of dataset.
        You could create your own dataset by inheriting from Dataset class. But you
        have to override __getitem__ and __len__ method to make sure that everything
        is all set.
            When you need to create a dataset defined by you self, and you wanna use
        MetaFlow as a framework and use MetaFlow.data.DataLoader to load your data,
        you have to use this class to pack your dataset. Then you could deliver it to
        DataLoader.

            This method is an iterator.
            You have to make sure it returns inputs(data) and targets(label).
